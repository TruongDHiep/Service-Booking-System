## Models

### service.appointment

Main model for booking appointments with complete workflow support.

**Inheritance:**

- `mail.thread`: Chatter and message tracking
- `mail.activity.mixin`: Activity management

**Key Fields:**

- `reference` (Char): Auto-generated appointment reference

**Business Logic:**

1. **Overlap Checking**:

   - Validates appointments don't conflict in time
   - Checks same service resource availability
   - Excludes cancelled appointments from validation

   - Prevents booking appointments in the past
   - Validation on create and write

   - Generated on creation using sequence
   - Format: BOOK/2025/0001

   - `action_cancel()`: Cancel appointment
   - `action_set_to_draft()`: Reset to draft
